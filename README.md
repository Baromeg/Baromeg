### Hello World ðŸ‘‹,
```
I am Baltasar, a graduated software engineer at General Assembly.  I am eager to collaborate on projects that develop a better and more sustainable tomorrow. I seek a developer role to make impactful contributions to both sides of the stack, share my ideas, and grow in a continued-learning and knowledge-sharing environment. 

Iâ€™ve thrived on leading and motivating people, improving operational processes and ultimately making customers happier. Iâ€™ve taken advantage of technologyâ€™s fast evolution to solve problems and enhance experiences, hence my admiration for the developer community.

After more than 12 years of hospitality experience, Iâ€™ve decided to blend my passion for software engineering and my creative and analytical side to join this vibrant community to pursue a career change and become part of the solution for todayâ€™s world challenges.
