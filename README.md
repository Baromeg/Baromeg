### Hello World ðŸ‘‹,
<div align="center"></div>
```
Hi! I am Baltasar, self-taught and graduated software engineer at General Assembly.

I seek a developer role to contribute to both sides of the stack, share my ideas, and grow in a continued-learning 
and knowledge-sharing environment. I am eager to collaborate on projects that develop a better and more sustainable 
tomorrow.

Iâ€™ve thrived on leading and motivating people, improving operational processes and ultimately creating memorable 
customer experiences. After more than 12 years of hospitality background, Iâ€™ve decided to blend my passion for 
software engineering, my problem-solving skills and my creativity to join the developer community to pursue a 
career change and become part of the solution for todayâ€™s world challenges.
