### Hello World ðŸ‘‹, I'm Baltasar

I've just graduated as Software Engineer at General Assembly in a 3 month immersive couse. I am seeking a full-stack developer role in a cooperative and knowledge-sharing environment to continue learning and improving my skills, where I can share my ideas and create impactful contributions.


I decided to blend my passion for software engineering, my hospitality skills and my creative and analytical thinking to pursue a career shift, becoming part of the solution for todayâ€™s world challenges.
